# ANBD | BookListingApp
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. The list of books will be provided via Google Books API in order to fetch results and display them to the user.<br>
This is the seventh project completed for the Android Basics Nanodegree program offered by Udacity in collaboration with Google. 
This is a proposed design for the Android app.

# ANBD | BookListingApp
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. The list of books will be provided via Google Books API in order to fetch results and display them to the user.
Project book listing. This is the seventh project completed for the Android Basics Nanodegree program offered by Udacity in collaboration with Google.
